    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to help filter through diagnosis code concepts using fuzzy keyword search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell blocks are designed to be run repeatedly as you iteratively read through the code list and copy the codes you want into the final list. The final goal is for the cell block output to only contain codes that you do not want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The General Case\n",
    "\n",
    "This code filtering notebook runs on the following template:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "current_code = ''\n",
    "keywords = []\n",
    "matches = FuzzySearch(keywords,combined['diagnosis_text'],fuzzy=True,threshold=90).search()\n",
    "\n",
    "diagnosis_dict[current_code] = [\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "]\n",
    "[code for code in matches if code not in diagnosis_dict[current_code]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Lengthy Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "For more diagnoses where there are many results returned (e.g. cancer), it might be more efficient to filter by codes you want to exclude:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "current_code = 'cancer'\n",
    "keywords = [\n",
    "    'cancer',\n",
    "    'carcinoma',\n",
    "    'malignant',\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "]\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    if not matches:\n",
    "        matches = FuzzySearch(keywords,combined['diagnosis_text'],fuzzy=True,threshold=90).search()\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    matches = []\n",

    "    'Angioma',\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Grouped Diagnoses\n",
    "\n",
    "For more groups of related diagnoses, (e.g. congenital heart disease), consider the following template instead where you define the keywords in a grouped dictionary with keys = diagnosis code and value = list of keywords:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "group_dict = {\n",
    "    'asd':['atrial septal defect', 'ASD', 'secundum ASD', 'primum ASD'],\n",

    "## FuzzySearch Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `FuzzySearch` class provides a recursive fuzzy string matching utility for identifying approximate matches of keyword patterns within a pandas `Series`. This is especially useful for noisy or free-text clinical data (e.g., diagnosis fields) where exact string matching is insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supports both **exact substring search** and **fuzzy matching** using Levenshtein distance.\n",
    "- Implements a **recursive, self-expanding** search strategy: matches from each iteration are used to seed further matching rounds.\n",
    "- Includes **candidate pruning** to improve efficiency and reduce false positives.\n",
    "- Configurable verbosity for monitoring intermediate matching behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pandas`\n",
    "- `fuzzywuzzy` or `rapidfuzz` (for `fuzz.partial_ratio`)"
